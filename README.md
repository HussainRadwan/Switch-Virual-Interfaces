# Switching and VLANs
Welcome to our exciting journey through the world of computer networking. We're not just learning about networking; we're diving deep into its core with two incredibly hands-on projects (Router on Stick && Switch Virtual Interfaces). It's like embarking on a thrilling adventure, where each step is a discovery in the vast universe of networks

- ### Router on Stick
  Here, we're not just reading about concepts; we're actually creating VLANs, configuring switches, and watching how data zips through our network. It's a bit like being a network conductor, orchestrating the flow of data with precision and skill. But that's just the warm-up

- ### Switch Virtual Interfaces
  The Switch Virtual Interfaces, is where things get really interesting. Now that you've got the basics down, we're moving onto something bigger and more complex. Imagine combining the power of a router and a switch into one that's what we're tackling here. You'll learn how to manage network traffic like a pro, understanding the INs and OUTs of multi-layer switching. This part is like solving a complex puzzle, where each piece is a different part of the network, and you're the one putting it all together.
